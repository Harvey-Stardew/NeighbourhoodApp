# NeighbourhoodApp
K-9rooms customer use app - Basically given up on but im rlly bad at github and couldnt make a new repo work.

Virtual pet care app is a virtual pet and the making of the app is ai aided because this is like the first app im acctually making and im really struggleing + in the kickoff call it was said ai aided projects were ok - not even sure if im gon make this, will probably use parts of it just to learn what the code should look like for smt else

IM SO INDESISIVE AHHHHHHHH

I will be working 100hrs on just 1 app i just havent decided what yet
